**"**I live by a simple creed: less is more.

<br> 
Temperance. That‚Äôs what they used to call it. The ability to manage your impulses, to temper your expectations, limit the extremities of the emotions you feel. Hunger does not need to become gluttony, the desire to live well need not twist into greed‚Ä¶ rinse and repeat for the rest of the deadly sins and you get what I mean.

<br>
This world rots from the inside out and it all boils down to excess.

<br>
More, more, more, that‚Äôs all anyone ever wants. Nothing is ever good enough. Well, I decided early on that a simple life was for me. Just the basics. Nothing more. I have a comfortable place to rest my head, I have a roof over me, I can eat, I do not live in fear. That is enough for me.

The money I earn in my line of work could make me rich, I‚Äôve seen plenty of other Bounty Hunter‚Äôs fall down that rabbit hole chasing wealth. One big catch after another, always just one more big catch away from cashing it all in and retiring.

<br>
Well, do I need to spell out what retirement looks like for people like us? I don‚Äôt think so.

<br>
So I temper my expectations. I live below my means and below the radar. That way I don‚Äôt catch the unwanted attention of the boogeyman. No one needs to know how much money I make each hit, they needn‚Äôt know just what a sum of riches I have accrued during my illustrious career, nor do they need to know what I plan to do with it all.

<br>
You can refer to me as Hunter, by the way.

<br>
Call it a nickname, call it a moniker, call it what you like - it‚Äôs the trade I‚Äôm in, and it suits. My line of work is best performed under certain protocols of secrecy, anyway. For your benefit and for mine. It would not do, if I was caught, for me to be able to blab to the authorities about who hired me and why. So I hide my face behind a mask, beneath a hood, and I keep to the shadows. Most of us do.

<br>
Like I said, we don‚Äôt last long when we start bragging about the bounties we‚Äôve collected.

<br>
It‚Äôs a sad world we share. One where the war for territory and looting rights has grown to such a height that people like me are hired to take out adversaries. There was a time where the title of Bounty Hunter had a more noble stature, we stood for something. A Brotherhood formed to undermine the regime. To assassinate those in power, and free the people.

<br>
Perhaps one day we will rise again.

But until then, I skulk in the shadows and bring death wherever I go.

Then I get paid.**"**
